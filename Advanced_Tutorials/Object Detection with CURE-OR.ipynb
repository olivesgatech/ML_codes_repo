    "The objective of this exercise is to familiarize you with the \"Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Object Recognition (CURE-OR)\" Dataset. This is one of the largest datasets generated as of yet to help benchmark studies regarding the robustness of object recognition algorithms under a variety of different conditions. For our purposes, we will be using a smaller version of this dataset, called \"mini CURE-OR\", that contains a smaller subset of the larger version for a variety of different backgrounds, camera poses, noise etc."
