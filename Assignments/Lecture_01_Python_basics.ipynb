    "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). Jupyter notebooks use Markdown cells for inserting any content that is _not_ code. You have seen already how we can create lists with Markdown. For the first exercise, we are going to have you create a blockquote containing a list that has in turn additional sublists, like shown in the image below. Your task is to recreate this within a single markdown cell and execute it. \n",
